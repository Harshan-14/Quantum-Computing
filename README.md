# Quantum-Computing
Analyzed the means to encode the information using qubits of the quantum circuits by leveraging the modules provided in the IBMâ€™s qiskit library. The image compression was done by passing the qubits inside the encoding quantum circuit via bottleneck layer. Cost function was calculated using the swap test.
